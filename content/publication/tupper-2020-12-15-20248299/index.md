abstract: |
  Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many
  jurisdictions and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as
  travel restrictions and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made
  ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if
  delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward
  transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing
  alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases.
  Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call
  loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We
  propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals
  without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible â€“ either with fast
  cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with
  screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by
  ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent
  delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.
