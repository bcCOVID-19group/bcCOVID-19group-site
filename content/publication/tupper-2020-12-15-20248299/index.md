abstract: 'Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many jurisdictions
  and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as travel restrictions
  and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by
  delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact
  tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without
  other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential
  growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional
  bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of
  control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals
  without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible â€“ either with fast cheap
  tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously
  chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic
  individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact
  tracing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding
