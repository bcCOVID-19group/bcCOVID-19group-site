  ##### Importance
  An effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will reduce morbidity and mortality
  and allow substantial relaxation of physical distancing policies. However, the
  ability of a vaccine to prevent infection or disease depends critically on
  protecting older individuals, who are at highest risk of severe disease.

  ##### Objective
  We quantitatively estimated the relative benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, in
  terms of preventing infection and death, with a particular focus on
  effectiveness in elderly people.

  ##### Design
  We applied compartmental mathematical modelling to determine the relative
  effects of vaccines that block infection and onward transmission, and those
  that prevent severe disease. We assumed that vaccines showing high efficacy in
  adults would be deployed, and examined the effects of lower vaccine efficacy
  among the elderly population.

  ##### Setting and participants
  Our mathematical model was calibrated to simulate the course of an epidemic
  among the entire population of British Columbia, Canada. Within our model, the
  population was structured by age and levels of contact.

  ##### Main outcome(s) and measure(s)
  We assessed the effectiveness of possible vaccines in terms of the predicted
  number of infections within the entire population, and deaths among people
  aged 65 years and over.

  ##### Results
  In order to reduce the overall rate of infections in the population, high
  rates of deployment to all age groups will be critical. However, to
  substantially reduce mortality among people aged 65 years and over, a vaccine
  must directly protect a high proportion of people in that group.

  ##### Conclusions and relevance
  Effective vaccines deployed to a large fraction of the population are
  projected to substantially reduce infection in an otherwise susceptible
  population. However, even if transmission were blocked highly effectively by
  vaccination of children and younger adults, overall mortality would not be
  substantially reduced unless the vaccine is also directly protective in
  elderly people. We strongly recommend: (i) the inclusion of people aged 65
  years and over in future trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates; (ii) careful
  monitoring of vaccine efficacy in older age groups following vaccination.
