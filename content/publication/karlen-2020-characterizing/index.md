abstract: |
  Since the beginning of the epidemic, daily reports of CoViD-19 cases,
  hospitalizations, and deaths from around the world have been publicly
  available. This paper describes methods to characterize broad features of the
  spread of the disease, with relatively long periods of constant transmission
  rates, using a new population modeling framework based on discrete-time
  difference equations. Comparative parameters are chosen for their weak
  dependence on model assumptions. Approaches for their point and interval
  estimation, accounting for additional sources of variance in the case data,
  are presented. These methods provide a basis to quantitatively assess the
  impact of changes to social distancing policies using publicly available data.
  As examples, data from Ontario and German states are analyzed using this
  framework. German case data show a small increase in transmission rates
  following the relaxation of lock-down rules on May 6, 2020. By combining case
  and death data from Germany, the mean and standard deviation of the time from
  infection to death are estimated.
