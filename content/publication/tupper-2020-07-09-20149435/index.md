abstract: 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with over 11 million
  cases worldwide. Currently there is no treatment and no vaccine. Interventions such
  as hand washing, masks, social distancing, and “social bubbles” are used to limit
  community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for
  a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions
  are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of
  “event R”, the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single
  infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event
  R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity
  of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish
  event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles
  that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission,
  or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be
  obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19
  transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing
