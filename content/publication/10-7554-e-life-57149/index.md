abstract: |
  We collated contact tracing data from COVID-19 clusters in Singapore and
  Tianjin, China and estimated the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission by
  estimating incubation periods and serial intervals. The mean incubation
  periods accounting for intermediate cases were 4.91 days (95%CI 4.35, 5.69)
  and 7.54 (95%CI 6.76, 8.56) days for Singapore and Tianjin, respectively. The
  mean serial interval was 4.17 (95%CI 2.44, 5.89) and 4.31 (95%CI 2.91, 5.72)
  days (Singapore, Tianjin). The serial intervals are shorter than incubation
  periods, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission may occur in a large
  proportion of transmission events (0.4–0.5 in Singapore and 0.6–0.8 in
  Tianjin, in our analysis with intermediate cases, and more without
  intermediates).  Given the evidence for pre-symptomatic transmission, it is
  vital that even individuals who appear healthy abide by public health measures
  to control COVID-19.
