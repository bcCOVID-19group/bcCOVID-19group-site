abstract: 'Background Antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2
  (SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to neutralize the virus in-vitro. Similarly, animal
  challenge models suggest that neutralizing antibodies isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected
  individuals prevent against disease upon re-exposure to the virus. Understanding
  the nature and duration of the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection
  is therefore critically important.Methods Between April and October 2020 we undertook
  a prospective cohort study of 3555 healthcare workers in order to elucidate the
  duration and dynamics of antibody responses following infection with SARS-CoV-2.
  After a formal performance evaluation against 169 PCR confirmed cases and negative
  controls, the Meso-Scale Discovery assay was used to quantify in parallel, antibody
  titers to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding-domain
  (RBD) of the S-protein. All seropositive participants were followed up monthly for
  a maximum of 7 months; those participants that were symptomatic, with known dates
  of symptom-onset, seropositive by the MSD assay and who provided 2 or more monthly
  samples were included in the analysis. Survival analysis was used to determine the
  proportion of sero-reversion (switching from positive to negative) from the raw
  data. In order to predict long-term antibody dynamics, two hierarchical longitudinal
  Gamma models were implemented to provide predictions for the lower bound (continuous
  antibody decay to zero, “Gamma-decay”) and upper bound (decay-to-plateau due to
  long lived plasma cells, “Gamma-plateau”) long-term antibody titers.Results A total
  of 1163 samples were provided from 349 of 3555 recruited participants who were symptomatic,
  seropositive by the MSD assay, and were followed up with 2 or more monthly samples.
  At 200 days post symptom onset, 99% of participants had detectable S-antibody whereas
  only 75% of participants had detectable N-antibody. Even under our most pessimistic
  assumption of persistent negative exponential decay, the S-antibody was predicted
  to remain detectable in 95% of participants until 465 days [95% CI 370-575] after
  symptom onset. Under the Gamma-plateau model, the entire posterior distribution
  of S-antibody titers at plateau remained above the threshold for detection indefinitely.
  Surrogate neutralization assays demonstrated a strong positive correlation between
  antibody titers to the S-protein and blocking of the ACE-2 receptor in-vitro [R2=0.72,
  p&lt;0.001]. By contrast, the N-antibody waned rapidly with a half-life of 60 days
  [95% CI 52-68].Discussion This study has demonstrated persistence of the spike antibody
  in 99% of participants at 200 days following SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and rapid decay
  of the nucleoprotein antibody. Diagnostic tests or studies that rely on the N-antibody
  as a measure of seroprevalence must be interpreted with caution. Our lowest bound
  prediction for duration of the spike antibody was 465 days and our upper bound predicted
  spike antibody to remain indefinitely in line with the long-term seropositivity
  reported for SARS-CoV infection. The long-term persistence of the S-antibody, together
  with the strong positive correlation between the S-antibody and viral surrogate
  neutralization in-vitro, has important implications for the duration of functional
  immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors

  line with UK government policy GOSH NHS Trust made the first diagnostic test available
  to all staff members in the hospital either as part of the study or outside the
  study. The GOSH charity provided the funding for follow up testing over the first
  6 months of the study. LG declares funding from Wellcome Post-Doctoral Research
  Fellowship (201470/Z/16/Z). AS declares funding from Wellcome Trust Global Health
  Clinical Ph.D. Fellowship (220565/Z/20/Z). GOSH NHS Trust hosts a NIHR Funded Biomedical
  Research Centre which provides infrastructure support permitting translational research.Author
