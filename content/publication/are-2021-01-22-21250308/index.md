abstract: |
  South Africa is currently experiencing a second wave of resurgence in COVID-19
  infection. In this modelling study, we use a Bayesian compartmental model to
  project possible spread of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa under
  various levels of lockdown restrictions. Our model suggests that strict
  lockdown restrictions will have to be in place up to the end of March 2021
  before cases can drop to levels observed, in September to early November 2020,
  after the first wave. On the one hand, extended lockdown restrictions have
  negative consequences â€“ albeit effective, they are not sustainable over
  extended periods. On the other hand, short lockdown restrictions over a few
  weeks will not have a lasting effect on the spread of the disease. Lockdown
  restrictions need to be supplemented with increased rapid testing, palliative
  support for the vulnerable, and implementations of other non-pharmaceutical
  interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandate. These multifaceted approaches could
  help keep cases under control until vaccines are widely available.
