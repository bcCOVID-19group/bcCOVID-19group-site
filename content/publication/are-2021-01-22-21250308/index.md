abstract: 'South Africa is currently experiencing a second wave of resurgence in COVID-19
  infection. In this modelling study, we use a Bayesian compartmental model to project
  possible spread of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa under various levels
  of lockdown restrictions. Our model suggests that strict lockdown restrictions will
  have to be in place up to the end of March 2021 before cases can drop to levels
  observed, in September to early November 2020, after the first wave. On the one
  hand, extended lockdown restrictions have negative consequences â€“ albeit effective,
  they are not sustainable over extended periods. On the other hand, short lockdown
  restrictions over a few weeks will not have a lasting effect on the spread of the
  disease. Lockdown restrictions need to be supplemented with increased rapid testing,
  palliative support for the vulnerable, and implementations of other non-pharmaceutical
  interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandate. These multifaceted approaches could help
  keep cases under control until vaccines are widely available.Competing Interest
