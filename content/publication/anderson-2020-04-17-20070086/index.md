abstract: 'Extensive physical distancing measures are currently the primary intervention
  against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It is therefore urgent to
  estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological
  model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in
  distancing measures, with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on
  attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases
  in British Columbia, Canada, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation
  and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical
  distancing (also known as social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examine
  the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has
  had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization
  and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66–0.89
  90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising
  physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which
  prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this
  threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation
  is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19
  in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty.
  Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures—if sufficiently strong
  and robustly followed— could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing
  measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.Competing
