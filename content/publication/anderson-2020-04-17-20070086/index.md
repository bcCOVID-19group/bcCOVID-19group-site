abstract: |
  Extensive physical distancing measures are currently the primary intervention
  against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It is therefore urgent
  to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian
  epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and
  able to participate in distancing measures, with the timing of these measures
  informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our
  model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, Canada, using an
  observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between
  symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical distancing
  (also known as social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examine the
  projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has
  had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in
  hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that
  approximately 0.78 (0.66–0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for
  individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this
  fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to
  grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts
  rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown,
  the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the
  population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional
  uncertainty.  Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing
  measures—if sufficiently strong and robustly followed— could control COVID-19
  transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the
  epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.
