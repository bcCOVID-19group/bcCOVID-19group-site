abstract: >
  There is no doubt that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is
  mutating and thus has the potential to adapt during the current pandemic. Whether this
  evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the
  disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising
  alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently
  known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to
  consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  While there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further
  adaptation, continued, evidence-based, analysis of evolutionary change is important so that
  public health measures can be adjusted in response to substantive changes in the infectivity
  or severity of COVID-19.
