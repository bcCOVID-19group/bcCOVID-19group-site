  Introduction Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  specific antibodies have been shown to neutralize the virus in-vitro.
  Understanding antibody dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection is therefore
  crucial. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is also vital for
  large seroprevalence surveys which inform government policies and public
  health interventions. However, rapidly waning antibodies following SARS-CoV-2
  infection could jeopardize the sensitivity of serological testing on which
  these surveys depend.Methods This prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2
  humoral dynamics in a central London hospital analyzed 137 serial samples
  collected from 67 participants seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 by the Meso-Scale
  Discovery assay. Antibody titers were quantified to the SARS-CoV-2
  nucleoprotein (N), spike (S-)protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of
  the S-protein. Titers were log-transformed and a multivariate log-linear model
  with time-since-infection and clinical variables was fitted by Bayesian
  methods.Results The mean estimated half-life of the N-antibody was 52 days
  (95% CI 42-65). The S- and RBD-antibody had significantly longer mean
  half-lives of 81 days (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI 55-137)
  respectively. An ACE-2-receptor competition assay demonstrated significant
  correlation between the S and RBD-antibody titers and ACE2-receptor blocking
  in-vitro.  The time-to-a-negative N-antibody test for 50% of the seropositive
  population was predicted to be 195 days (95% CI 163-236).Discussion After
  SARS-CoV-2 infection, the predicted half-life of N-antibody was 52 days with
  50% of seropositive participants becoming seronegative to this antibody at 195
  days. Widely used serological tests that depend on the N-antibody will
  therefore significantly underestimate the prevalence of infection following
  the majority of infections.Significance statement We believe that our study
  has significant and urgent public health and translational impact.  Firstly,
  our findings demonstrate that the half-life of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein
  antibody is only 52 days. This has immediate and important implications for
  large-scale seroprevalence surveys, government policy and mathematical
  modelling predictions which rely on serological tests that target this
  antibody. Secondly, the slower decay of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody
  identified in this study makes assays to the spike protein a more reliable
  target for serological assays in the longer term. We demonstrate a strong
  positive linear correlation between spike/RBD antibody and ACE-2 receptor
  binding in vitro. Our findings are therefore likely to reflect the time to
  loss of a functional antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.
