abstract: 'Under the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social
  distancing and lockdowns, household transmission has been shown to be significant
  for COVID-19, posing challenges for reducing incidence in settings where people
  are asked to self-isolate at home and to spend increasing amounts of time at home
  due to distancing measures. Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region
  have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce
  a stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution
  in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence
  in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate
  the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution
  the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result
  suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant
  differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct
  dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering
  individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in
  cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.Competing
