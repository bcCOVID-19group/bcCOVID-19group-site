abstract: |
  Under the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social
  distancing and lockdowns, household transmission has been shown to be
  significant for COVID-19, posing challenges for reducing incidence in settings
  where people are asked to self-isolate at home and to spend increasing amounts
  of time at home due to distancing measures. Accordingly, characteristics of
  households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity
  of the virus. We introduce a stochastic epidemiological model to examine the
  impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission
  dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of
  the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of
  distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only
  different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result
  suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause
  significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions
  drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model
  suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household
  can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are
  more larger households.
