abstract: |
  Following successful widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions aiming to
  control COVID-19, many jurisdictions are moving towards reopening economies
  and borders. Given that little immunity has developed in most populations,
  re-establishing higher contact rates within and between populations carries
  substantial risks. Using a Bayesian epidemiological model, we estimate the
  leeway to reopen in a range of national and regional jurisdictions that have
  experienced different COVID-19 epidemics.  We estimate the risks associated
  with different levels of reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to
  introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely varying leeway to
  reopen, high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible burdens per
  introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions. We recommend a
  cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong
  monitoring for changes in transmission.
