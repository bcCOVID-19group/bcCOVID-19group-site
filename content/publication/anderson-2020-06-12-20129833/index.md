abstract: 'Following successful widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions aiming
  to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions are moving towards reopening economies and
  borders. Given that little immunity has developed in most populations, re-establishing
  higher contact rates within and between populations carries substantial risks. Using
  a Bayesian epidemiological model, we estimate the leeway to reopen in a range of
  national and regional jurisdictions that have experienced different COVID-19 epidemics.
  We estimate the risks associated with different levels of reopening and the likely
  burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely
  varying leeway to reopen, high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible
  burdens per introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions. We recommend
  a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring
  for changes in transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
