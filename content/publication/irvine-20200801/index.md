abstract: |
  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities house thousands of
  undocumented immigrants in environments discordant with the public health
  recommendations to reduce the transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus
  (COVID-19). Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE
  Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we
  implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model
  to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention
  facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit
  (ICU) capacity.  Models considered three scenarios of transmission
  (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons
  across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are
  expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario ($R_0 = 2.5$),
  while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a
  more pessimistic ($R_0 = 7$) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are
  more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive
  cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most
  optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE
  facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and
  outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local
  ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU
  bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly
  implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of
  life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the
  pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in
  ICEtextquoterights detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread
  necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees
  widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the
  community.
