  ##### Background 
  In March 2021, a number of regulatory and advisory bodies around the world
  recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults
  pending further review of the risk for vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune
  thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As an example, we consider the Canadian province of
  British Columbia (BC) which halted its front-line workers vaccination program
  with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province received an additional 246,700
  doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in the weeks before April 11th, enough to provide
  the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line workers. It is
  unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines can be immediately made
  available to front-line workers.

  ##### Methods
  We reviewed the latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to:
  1. Compare the expected number of deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the
     scenarios of immediately continuing vaccination of front-line workers with
     the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines from a
     societal perspective, and
  2. Compare the individual mortality risk of immediately receiving the
     AstraZeneca vaccine with waiting to receive an mRNA vaccine later from a
     personal perspective.

  ##### Results
  We estimate that if British Columbia continues the front-line worker
  vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see
  approximately 45,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 800 fewer hospitalizations, 120
  fewer COVID-related deaths, and 2,300 fewer cases of Long COVID from April
  15th to October 1st, 2021, for an expected number of VIPIT-related deaths of
  0.674 [95% CI 0.414-0.997]. In the same period and in areas of high
  transmission ($R_0=1.30$), the projected excess risk of mortality due to COVID-19
  and VIPIT was significantly higher in the delayed vaccination with mRNA
  vaccines scenario (3.5 to 4.5 times higher risk) than that of immediate
  vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine for those between 30 and 69 years of
  age. In areas with lower levels of transmission ($R_0=1.15$), the projected
  excess risk of mortality was 1.8 to 3.4 times higher in the delayed
  vaccination with mRNA vaccines scenario for those between 30 and 69 years of
  age. For those under 30, immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine
  posed a higher risk than delayed vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, regardless
  of the level of transmission in the community.

  ##### Conclusions 
  The benefits of continuing immunization of front-line workers with the
  AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh the risk both at a societal level and at a
  personal risk level for those over 40, and those over 30 in high-risk areas.
