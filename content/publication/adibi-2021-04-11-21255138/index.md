abstract: 'Background In March 2021, a number of regulatory and advisory bodies around
  the world recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger
  adults pending further review of the risk for vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune
  thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As an example, we consider the Canadian province of British
  Columbia (BC) which halted its front-line workers vaccination program with the AstraZeneca
  vaccine. The province received an additional 246,700 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine
  in the weeks before April 11th, enough to provide the first dose of vaccine to all
  unvaccinated front-line workers. It is unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines
  can be immediately made available to front-line workers.Methods We reviewed the
  latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to 1) compare the expected
  number of deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately continuing
  vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in
  favour of mRNA vaccines from a societal perspective, and 2) compare the individual
  mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine with waiting to
  receive an mRNA vaccine later from a personal perspective.Results We estimate that
  if British Columbia continues the front-line worker vaccination program with the
  AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see approximately 45,000 fewer cases of COVID-19,
  800 fewer hospitalizations, 120 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 2,300 fewer cases
  of Long COVID from April 15th to October 1st, 2021, for an expected number of VIPIT-related
  deaths of 0.674 [95% CI 0.414-0.997]. In the same period and in areas of high transmission
  (R0=1.30), the projected excess risk of mortality due to COVID-19 and VIPIT was
  significantly higher in the delayed vaccination with mRNA vaccines scenario (3.5
  to 4.5 times higher risk) than that of immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca
  vaccine for those between 30 and 69 years of age. In areas with lower levels of
  transmission (R0=1.15), the projected excess risk of mortality was 1.8 to 3.4 times
  higher in the delayed vaccination with mRNA vaccines scenario for those between
  30 and 69 years of age. For those under 30, immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca
  vaccine posed a higher risk than delayed vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, regardless
  of the level of transmission in the community.Conclusions The benefits of continuing
  immunization of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh the
  risk both at a societal level and at a personal risk level for those over 40, and
  those over 30 in high-risk areas.Competing Interest StatementMS has received honoraria
