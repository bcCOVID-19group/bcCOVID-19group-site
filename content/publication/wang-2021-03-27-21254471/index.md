abstract: 'Serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 provide a paradigm for estimating the number
  of individuals who have had infection in the past (including cases that are not
  detected by routine testing, which has varied over the course of the pandemic and
  between jurisdictions). Classical statistical approaches to such estimation do not
  incorporate case counts over time, and may be inaccurate due to uncertainty about
  the sensitivity and specificity of the serology test. In this work, we provide a
  joint Bayesian model for case counts and serological data, integrating uncertainty
  through priors on the sensitivity and specificity. We also model the Phases of the
  pandemic with exponential growth and decay. This model improves upon maximum likelihood
  estimates by conditioning on more data, and by taking into account the epidemiological
  trajectory. We apply our model to the greater Vancouver area, British Columbia,
  Canada with data acquired during Phase 1 of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe
  authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was funded
