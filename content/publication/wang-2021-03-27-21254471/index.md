abstract: |
  Serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 provide a paradigm for estimating the number of
  individuals who have had infection in the past (including cases that are not
  detected by routine testing, which has varied over the course of the pandemic
  and between jurisdictions). Classical statistical approaches to such
  estimation do not incorporate case counts over time, and may be inaccurate due
  to uncertainty about the sensitivity and specificity of the serology test. In
  this work, we provide a joint Bayesian model for case counts and serological
  data, integrating uncertainty through priors on the sensitivity and
  specificity. We also model the Phases of the pandemic with exponential growth
  and decay. This model improves upon maximum likelihood estimates by
  conditioning on more data, and by taking into account the epidemiological
  trajectory. We apply our model to the greater Vancouver area, British
  Columbia, Canada with data acquired during Phase 1 of the pandemic.Competing
