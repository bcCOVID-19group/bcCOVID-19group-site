  Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19) are particularly variable in the context of transmission within
  locations such as long-term health care (LTHC) facilities. We sought to
  characterise the heterogeneity of R0 across known outbreaks within these
  facilities. We used a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that have
  occurred within LTHC facilities in British Columbia, Canada. We estimated R0
  with a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model of susceptible, exposed, infected,
  and recovered individuals, that incorporates heterogeneity of R0 between
  facilities. We further compared these estimates to those obtained with
  standard methods that utilize the exponential growth rate and maximum
  likelihood. The total size of an outbreak varied dramatically, with a range of
  attack rates of 2%–86%. The Bayesian analysis provides more constrained
  overall estimates of R0 = 2.19 (90% CrI [credible interval] 0.19–6.69) than
  standard methods, with a range within facilities of 0.48–10.08. We further
  estimated that intervention led to 57% (47%–66%) of all cases being averted
  within the LTHC facilities, or 73% (63%–78%) when using a model with
  multi-level intervention effect. Understanding the risks and impact of
  intervention are essential in planning during the ongoing global pandemic,
  particularly in high-risk environments such as LTHC facilities.
