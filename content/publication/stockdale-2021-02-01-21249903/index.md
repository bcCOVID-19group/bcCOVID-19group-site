abstract: 'Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19) are particularly variable in the context of transmission within
  locations such as long-term health care (LTHC) facilities. We sought to characterise
  the heterogeneity of R0 across known outbreaks within these facilities. We used
  a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that have occurred within LTHC facilities
  in British Columbia, Canada. We estimated R0 with a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic
  model of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals, that incorporates
  heterogeneity of R0 between facilities. We further compared these estimates to those
  obtained with standard methods that utilize the exponential growth rate and maximum
  likelihood. The total size of an outbreak varied dramatically, with a range of attack
  rates of 2%–86%. The Bayesian analysis provides more constrained overall estimates
  of R0 = 2.19 (90% CrI [credible interval] 0.19–6.69) than standard methods, with
  a range within facilities of 0.48–10.08. We further estimated that intervention
  led to 57% (47%–66%) of all cases being averted within the LTHC facilities, or 73%
  (63%–78%) when using a model with multi-level intervention effect. Understanding
  the risks and impact of intervention are essential in planning during the ongoing
  global pandemic, particularly in high-risk environments such as LTHC facilities.Competing
