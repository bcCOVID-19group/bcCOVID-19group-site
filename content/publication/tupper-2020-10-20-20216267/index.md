abstract: 'Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because
  closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools
  with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk
  and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that
  children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that
  transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature
  on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled
  by heterogeneity, or “overdispersion” in transmission, with many exposures yielding
  little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing
  sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in
  children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the
  possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based
  model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes
  and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions
  to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission.
  We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly
  variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging
  from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled,
  initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large
  transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters
  do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring
  (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We
  suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these “unfortunate events”,
  even if they are expected to be rare.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
