abstract: |
  Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because
  closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened
  schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools
  were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is
  becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in
  school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We
  describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the
  apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or “overdispersion”
  in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward
  transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward
  transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and
  youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the
  possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic
  individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations
  for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and
  environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are
  known to contribute to variability in transmission.  We find that even
  small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable
  transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging
  from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation
  protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic
  individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the
  transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any
  case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for
  example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention.
  We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these “unfortunate
  events”, even if they are expected to be rare.
