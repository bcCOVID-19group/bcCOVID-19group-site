summary: |
  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [eighth
  report](/post/2021-08-18-report/slides.pdf) on the status of COVID-19 in British
  Columbia (August 18, 2021). For the past 5 weeks, infections throughout BC
  have been growing exponentially. This report shows that the growth in cases
  has been steady and it is urgent to reduce transmission and expand vaccination
  coverage to avoid overwhelming BC’s medical system. In the video accompanying
  this report (to appear), [Dr. Eric Cytrynbaum](/authors/cyrtyn/) gives a brief
  presentation highlighting the main points contained in the report.
