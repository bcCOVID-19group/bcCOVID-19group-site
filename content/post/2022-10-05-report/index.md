summary: |
  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [twenty-fifth
  report](/post/2022-10-05-report/COVID19group-2022-10-05.pdf) on the status of
  COVID-19 in British Columbia (October 5th, 2022). This report shows that the
  Omicron BA.5 wave persists with high rates of infection. The prolonged nature
  of the BA.5. wave is consistent with waning immunity from infections and
  vaccinations early in the year.Future projections predict a rise in cases,
  even without new variants, which are better able to evade immunity.
  Under-reporting of cases is extremely high, with ~100-fold more infections
  currently than reported cases.
