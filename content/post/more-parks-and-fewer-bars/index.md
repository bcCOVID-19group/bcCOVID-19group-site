So far, BC has been one of the best places to live in the world during the
pandemic. When COVID-19 first came here, it was controlled for weeks with strong
contact tracing, testing and reporting, and changes to long-term care. Travelers
and others at risk were willing to isolate and keep contacts low. After
transmission took off, it was detected early, and was slowed very effectively
without strict lockdowns or fines; parks mainly stayed open, people cooperated
with health guidelines and Dr Henry’s calm updates showed British Columbians how
well we were doing. But our measures came at a high social cost, and one impact
has been on mental health. Within BC, more people have suffered in terms of
[anxiety and
depression](https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Covid19-Modelling_Update.pdf) than have
been directly affected by the virus itself.  Social isolation in particular has
a terrible cost in terms of [mental
health](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/opinion/coronavirus-mental-illness-depression.html).
It’s essential to have ways to socialize while minimizing the risk of
transmission.

One of the most consistent lessons we’ve learned about COVID-19 is that [outdoor
transmission is much rarer than indoor
transmission](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v2).
The reasons for this are still unclear, but it may be because [aerosols are
quickly blown away
outdoors](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/),
because even in outdoor crowds people are not as closely packed as they are at
indoor events, and because people are [less likely to sing, shout, or talk
loudly while
outside](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144832v1.full.pdf).

In contrast, house parties, bars, nightclubs, and restaurants are risky
locations for COVID-19 transmission for many reasons. They are indoors, they may
be loud and require people to shout, and drinking often relaxes people to the
point where they don’t take appropriate precautions. Venues are often too small
to realistically allow 2m of social distance. One of the appeals of bars and
nightclubs is the opportunity to meet strangers, thus breaking social bubbles.
Many recent outbreaks in BC have been associated with these and other indoor
activities. Canada Day weekend in [Kelowna led to 130 new COVID-19
infections](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/one-month-after-canada-day-outbreak-kelowna-struggles-to-balance-tourism-and-covid-19-sense-1.5671801)
due to indoor gatherings and private parties. Recently, private parties in
Vancouver were linked to at least [45 COVID-19
cases](https://globalnews.ca/news/7256362/private-parties-vancouver-coronavirus/).
Several food establishments and nightclubs experienced [significant COVID
outbreaks](https://www.straight.com/food/covid-19-in-bc-health-guidelines-adjusted-for-nightlife-as-three-metro-vancouver-restaurants)
in the Lower Mainland. Of course, any changes that can be made to the
organization of indoor activities in order to reduce the transmission risk are
valuable. But since we need to socialize, and outdoor settings are the safest
way we know how to do that, we should be doing everything we can to move social
activities outside. One approach many Canadian cities have made is changes of
policy to facilitate restaurants and other businesses to do this, including
[allowing temporary outdoor
patios](https://vancouver.ca/doing-business/expedited-patio-program.aspx) for
restaurants or permitting more food trucks.

If we want to maximize opportunities for safe social interaction, and build up
physical and mental health, we need to socialize in parks, not just in indoor
venues. But bars (and other indoor social venues) have been open for weeks now
in British Columbia. Meanwhile, a number of restrictions have been put on parks,
limiting the number of people that can use them. This can make park access a
scarce resource that people might ‘hoard’, for example by taking up a parking
spot all day. This limits access to those who can arrive early or get a day pass
in advance. Even if we must limit crowds — which we may have to do for capacity
reasons, rather than COVID-19 transmission — rising hourly rates would equalize
access and prevent hoarding of hard-to-get spots.

Instead of restricting parks, we should be opening them more — — allowing more
parking, not less; opening more outdoor areas; encouraging bars and restaurants
to have even more outdoor space, even allowing businesses to set up in parks
wherever possible. Anything that we can do to make parks more attractive in the
coming colder and rainier months is vital, such as providing extensive covered
areas and outdoor heating. And at home, if we have the space to do so, we should
move parties outside.

Winter is coming, and the pandemic is still with us. The relaxation of social
distancing has already led us to a phase of exponential growth, and this will
only be worsened by reopening schools. We may have to enter another phase of
severe restrictions, and we will not have indoor socialization spaces to provide
us with much-needed human contact. We need to enjoy our outdoor spaces to the
maximum extent while we can, and to the best extent possible into the coming
winter.
