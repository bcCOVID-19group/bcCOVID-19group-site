summary: |
  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [twenty-seventh
  report](/post/2023-01-25-report/COVID19group-2023-01-25.pdf) on the status of
  COVID-19 in British Columbia (January 25th, 2023).  Omicron continues to be
  dominated by BA.5\* variants, particularly descendants like BQ.1\* that carry
  many mutations that reduce antibody recognition. BQ.1\* has risen to an
  estimated current frequency of 50% in BC and in Canada. Nevertheless, case
  numbers are rising and falling in a manner that depends less on these variants
  and more on population-level immunity and the waning of this immunity. This is
  good news, suggesting that population-level immunity is largely protective
  against BQ.1\* as well.
