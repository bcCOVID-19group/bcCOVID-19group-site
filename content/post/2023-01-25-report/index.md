summary: |
  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [twenty-seventh
  report](/post/2023-01-25-report/COVID19group-2023-01-25.pdf) on the status of
  COVID-19 in British Columbia (January 25th, 2023).  SARS-CoV-2 lineages BQ.1
  and XBB and their descendants, which carry several mutations reducing antibody
  recognition, are the fastest spreading variants in Canada. BQ.1* has risen to
  a current frequency of ~85% across the country. Case numbers are undergoing
  only modest fluctuations, reflecting the rise and fall of population-level
  immunity through infections, vaccinations, and waning. Models project future
  declines in case numbers over the short term, with the rising tide of XBB.1.5
  likely having only a modest impact.
