summary: |
  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [twenty-sixth
  report](/post/2022-11-23-report/COVID19group-2022-11-23.pdf) on the status of
  COVID-19 in British Columbia (November 23rd, 2022). Omicron continues to be
  dominated by BA.5\* variants, particularly descendants like BQ.1\* that carry many
  mutations that reduce antibody recognition. BQ.1\* has risen to an estimated
  current frequency of 50% in BC and in Canada. Nevertheless, case numbers are
  rising and falling in a manner that depends less on these variants and more on
  population-level immunity and the waning of this immunity. This is good news,
  suggesting that population-level immunity in Canada is largely protective
  against BQ.1\* as well.
