  The BC COVID-19 Modelling team issued their [twenty-fourth
  report](/post/2022-08-17-report/COVID19group-2022-08-17.pdf) on the status of
  COVID-19 in British Columbia (August 17th, 2022). This report shows that the Omicron BA.5 wave has peaked across much of Canada.  Nevertheless, risks of infection remain high, with infections likely 100-fold more common than reported cases at present.
