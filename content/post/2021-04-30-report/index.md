    Based on model in Day et al. (2020) with age-based vaccination campaign,
    age-based contact matrix (Mulberry et al. 2021), and two distancing classes as
    in Anderson et al. (2020). Calculates the expected daily growth rate (leading
    eigenvalue) if we were to go back up to transmission levels of VOC in
    February/March on the date shown on the x-axis, accounting for how the
    vaccination roll-out reduces number of susceptible individuals
